# ðŸ¤˜ Hi, I'm Calvin

I write about all my completed projects over at my [Build Log](https://calvins.pizza) (I call this a "BLOG")

But here on GH you might find some unfinished or more experimental work as well.

<br />

## Current Working Project, [clippi](https://github.com/CMorooney/clippi)
I have been long putting together an [LZX](https://lzxindustries.net/) video synth and with the eventual arrival of my [TBC2](https://lzxindustries.net/products/tbc2) module I finally had a reliable way to send external video into the synth. While I initially had a lot of fun with an old VCR and thrift store VHS finds....well, it turns out having to rewind all those VHS' kind sucks, hah.

So I'm builindg a dedicated clip looper using a Raspberry Pi 4. The Pi hosts a local web server/site so that you can upload files or input youtube links (with time stamp bounds!) via a web interface. The Pi then is constantly looping whatever content what is provided, broken up into 12 banks of 12 clips. There is a [NeoPixel Ring](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2853) that shows the progress of the current looping clip and a [7 Segment Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/811) to show the current bank & video index. There are 6 switches, each OR'd with a 3.5mm trigger in to control the current bank, video, mode, and other features of the machine.

I am often posting my progress on my Instagram stories, so if you're curious you can [see the the work so far piece by piece](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18034629643648571/)
